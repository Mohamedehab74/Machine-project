## ðŸ“š Dataset Descriptions:

- **vehicle.csv**  
  A dataset used for unsupervised learning (clustering) tasks, specifically with the K-Means algorithm. Here, it clusters cars according to some parameters like width, size,...etc.

- **horsesurgery.csv**  
  A dataset related to horse health, deciding whether it is needed to perform an operation on it or not. It is used for binary classification tasks applying Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

- **houseprices.csv**  
  A dataset containing real estate data, used for building a regression model to predict house prices.
